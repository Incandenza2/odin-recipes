        <3>Steps</3>
            <ol>
                <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper.</li>
                <li>Slice the top and bottom off of the orange.</li>
                <li>Position the knife next to the pith (the white stuff inside the peel) and make a slice to the bottom following the shape of the rind. Trim the whole fruit.</li>
                <li>Hold the fruit in your hand, and position the knife on one side of the section. Carefully make a slice downward toward the center, making sure to not cut through the entire orange.</li>
                <li>Repeat on the other side of the section, popping the section out. Continue with the rest of the fruit.</li>
                <li>Place segments on the parchment. Freeze for 4 hours.</li>
                <li>Remove frozen orange segments and place in a freezer-safe bag. Seal, and remove excess air.</li>
            </ol>
